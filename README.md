# DSA_JAVA

This repository contains Java implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It is structured to support systematic practice and revision for coding interviews and placement preparation.

##  Folder Structure

- **Array**  
  Contains Java solutions to fundamental and advanced problems related to arrays. These include operations like searching, sorting, sliding window, and more.

- **Blind75**  
  A curated list of top 75 problems (commonly known as "Blind 75") frequently asked in technical interviews. This folder includes optimal solutions in Java.

- **Recursion**  
  Java programs that demonstrate recursive approaches for solving classic problems like permutations, subsets, factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking challenges.

- **Sorting**  
  Implementations of standard sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, etc., with code written from scratch in Java.

##  Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA, Git, GitHub

##  Purpose

This repository is part of my journey to strengthen my problem-solving skills in Java. It aligns with placement preparation, specifically targeting:
- Mastery over DSA concepts
- Cracking technical interviews
- Practicing consistency with Git and GitHub

##  Future Additions

- Linked List, Stack, Queue
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design Notes (maybe!)

##  Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but feel free to fork it or get inspiration for your own DSA practice repo.
